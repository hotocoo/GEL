# Gamified Learning Platform

A comprehensive, web-based gamified learning platform for university-level education, inspired by Duolingo and RPG games. Users can master subjects through interactive lessons, adaptive challenges, and RPG-style progression.

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern UI libraries (Material-UI, Framer Motion for animations)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for scalable data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access (students, admins)
- **Gamification**: Custom systems for points, levels, achievements, quests
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for leaderboards and social interactions

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Subject Coverage**: All university categories (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, History, Literature, etc.) with rich media support.
- **RPG Progression**: Character levels, skill trees, customizable avatars, achievements, quests.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment for challenging questions.
- **Effective Teaching**: Key points, summaries, interactive explanations, and simulations.
- **Gamification Mechanics**: Daily streaks, badges, milestones, narrative paths.
- **Social Elements**: Leaderboards, friend challenges, community forums.
- **Admin Tools**: Content management, analytics, moderation.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive design, animations, engaging interfaces for all devices.

### System Architecture
- **Frontend (React)**: Handles user interactions, renders UI, manages state with Redux or Context API.
- **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: Provides RESTful APIs, handles authentication, processes game logic, integrates with MongoDB.
- **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores user data, courses, progress, achievements, social interactions.
- **Deployment**: Scalable setup with Docker, potential cloud hosting (AWS, Heroku).

## Project Structure
- `/frontend`: React application
- `/backend`: Node.js/Express server
- `/shared`: Common types and utilities (if needed)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up MongoDB (e.g., using MongoDB Atlas or local installation).
3. Set up backend: `cd backend && npm install && npm start` (runs on port 5000).
4. Set up frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start` (runs on port 3000).
5. Access the app at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing
- Run unit tests with `npm test` in frontend.
- Use tools like Postman for API testing.
- Ensure accessibility with tools like Lighthouse.

## Deployment
- Deploy backend to Heroku or AWS.
- Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify.
- Set environment variables (e.g., JWT_SECRET, MONGO_URI).

## Features
- User authentication with RPG profiles.
- Gamified learning with XP, levels, streaks, achievements.
- Adaptive questions and effective teaching.
- Leaderboard and social features.
- Admin panel for content management.
